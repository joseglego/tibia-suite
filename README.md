## Idea
This project is a wide project based on [Tibia](https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews), which is a MMORPG from [Cipsoft](https://www.cipsoft.com/index.php/en/)

The main idea is build a general system based on simple components to explain step by step all the work related (FrontEnd, BackEnd, CLI, External & Internal Apps, Web Technologies).

I haven't play during last years. So, if you think I'm missing something or I should include something else feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/joseglego/tibia-suite/issues/new)

- [CLI](packages/cli/README.md) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tibia-suite/cli.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/@tibia-suite/cli) | [Project](https://github.com/joseglego/tibia-suite/projects/3)

## Extra Information
This was just an idea, to practice, build and write notes. But, while I was doing the research related I found 2 projects already in production stage, which obviously give me some hints and help in the development of the idea and, in some cases even recommendation for code.:
- [Tibia Data API](https://tibiadata.com/)
- [Tibia GraphQL API](https://github.com/raulfdm/tibia-api)

Also, I discussed this with some friends and 2 mentors.
